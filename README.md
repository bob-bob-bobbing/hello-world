# hello-world
What have we here?

I am interested in uploading the Java backup application I have written.

I am also interested in creating a FaceBook alternative, (based on LBRY?)

I worked for 30 years on ICL's mainframe operating system, porting Networker's backup solution to that operating system, 
and the web front end for an eCommerce system using SQL, Perl and C++.
